          SMART DETECTION OF DERMATOPHYTE FUNGI
        </h3>
        <p>Dermatophyte fungi are a significant global public health concern, causing skin infections that affect 20-25% of the population annually. 
          Cases have been rising, with a 15% increase reported by the WHO between 2015 and 2020. 
          Traditional identification methods, such as morphological analysis and culture-based techniques, are slow, labor-intensive, and prone to errors.
           Deep learning (DL) offers a promising solution by automating and improving dermatophyte identification through advanced algorithms and neural networks. 
           DL-based methods can enhance accuracy, reduce processing times, and improve treatment outcomes</p>
